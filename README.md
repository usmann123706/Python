# Online Retail Exploratory Data Analysis with Python

## Project Overview
This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the "Online Retail" dataset. As a data analyst my role is to help the company uncover valuable insights. 
The data is from an online retail store between 2010 and 2011.

## Project Objectives
- **Data Description**: Understand the dataset and its features.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, and correct anomalies (negative values, duplicates).
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize the trends in the data using various plots.
- **Insights**: Identify important trends like the busiest sales periods, top-selling products, and countries, and detect any outliers.
- **Recommendations**: Provide data-driven recommendations to improve online retail performance.

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains the following columns:
- **InvoiceNo**: Unique invoice number of the transaction.
- **StockCode**: Unique code for the product.
- **Description**: Description of the product.
- **Quantity**: Quantity of the product sold.
- **InvoiceDate**: Date and time of the transaction.
- **UnitPrice**: Price of the product.
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier of the customer.
- **Country**: The country where the transaction took place.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**
- Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`

To install the required libraries, use the following:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy

## Steps to Run the Analysis
### Load the Dataset:

Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Inspect the first few rows to understand the structure.

### Data Cleaning:

Check for missing values and fill them appropriately.
Handle negative quantities and unit prices by converting them to zero.
Remove or handle duplicates.
Identify outliers using Z-scores and box plots, and decide on their treatment.

###Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Generate summary statistics for the dataset.
Visualize sales trends across months, days of the week, and product types.
Analyze product sales and identify the busiest periods.

### Data Visualization:

Use bar charts to explore quantities sold by month and day of the week.
Generate boxplots to identify outliers in Quantity and UnitPrice.

### Results and Insights:

Busiest sales months and days.
Top-selling products and countries.
Key insights on customer purchasing patterns.

### Recommendations:

Based on the data insights, propose recommendations to optimize business performance, like focusing on high-demand products or targeting the most active regions.

###Code Implementation
See the accompanying Python code in the online_retail_analysis.py file for the full implementation of the steps described above.
